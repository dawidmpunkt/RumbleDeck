# Decky Plugin for the DRV2605 based Rumble Mod for Valve's Steam Deck

For the mod see: [Rumble Mod](https://github.com/dawidmpunkt/rumble-for-steamdeck/)

The plugin supports two DRV2605 Drivers via a I2C multiplexer as of now.
Triggering the rumble signal on both drivers simultaneously works.

# TODO
- Add option to add custom settings for drivers

# current issues
* backend (/backend/out/rumble-sniffer) does not compile automatically. I do not understand why, yet.
